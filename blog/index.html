Forward-thinking designers are embracing native plants — species that evolved in your local ecosystem and thrive without supplemental irrigation, fertilizer, or pesticide once established. Native landscapes support pollinators, require 60-80% less water than conventional landscapes, reduce maintenance costs dramatically, and create habitats for birds and beneficial insects. The aesthetic has evolved too — today's native gardens are sophisticated, layered, and seasonally dynamic, far from the "weedy meadow" stereotype. The key is designing with natives intentionally, using the same principles of color, texture, structure, and rhythm that guide any good landscape design.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Creating Outdoor Rooms: Designing for How You Actually Live</h3><p>The best outdoor spaces aren't just pretty — they're functional extensions of your home. Think of your landscape as a series of outdoor rooms, each with a purpose. A dining area near the kitchen with overhead shade. A lounging space with comfortable seating and a fire feature for cool evenings. A play area visible from multiple windows. A private garden retreat for reading and reflection. Defining these zones with changes in flooring material, elevation, plantings, and structures creates distinct experiences within a single property. The result is a landscape you actually use daily, not just admire from inside.</p></div></div></div></section>
